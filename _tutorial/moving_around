## Moving around Deemak

Moving around Deemak is same as any shell. Type `ls` to see something like this:

Objects:
   README
   some_book
   some_chest (locked)
From inside here, you can go to:
   some_place
   some_vault (locked)

This means the location has different objects you can read. All objects are `files` physically present. You can access/read them using `read` command. You maybe asked to eat your food, read a book, talk to friend, etc. All actions are simply referring to READing that object or GOing to that directory.

Use the `go` command to change your current location to a possible destination. You can do so by typing `go some_place`. As simple as that!

Here are IMPORTANT things to note:
1) If you see `(none)` in the list of objects/places, this means there are no objects or places to go to.
2) If you see `(locked)` next to an object or place, this means you cannot access it right now. You will have to solve/unlock them first using a key. Check out `classroom/secrets` file to understand how to unlock them.
3) Try `help <COMMAND>` to see help for a specific command, and more use-cases of that command. It will definitely come in handy.

* Great! Now go inside classroom to learn more!
