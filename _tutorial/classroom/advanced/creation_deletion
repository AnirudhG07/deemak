Do you wanna know how to create and delete files? Simple, use `tap` command to create files/directories and use `del` to delete them. You might need to check out `help` for each of them to know what parameters to pass.

Try creating a file with `tap my_first_file`. You can also be creative and directory add it to your HOME directory with `..` as you learnt in the `filesystem` lecture.

Now go inside `playground` and delete the `delete_me` file. Try on creating and deleting directories to understand more of what's going on.


PS. Sorry, you can write text inside them yet. Well, why do you need to? Just focus on cracking and Solving. Deemak will take input's from you when needed. 
If you are creating your own SEKAI, please use this command to create and delete files since it will automatically handle the object metadata handling itself.
